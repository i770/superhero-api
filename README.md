# ü¶∏ Superhero API

This is a RESTful API built with Flask that allows clients to interact with a fictional universe of superheroes and their powers. It demonstrates key backend development concepts such as routing, models, validations, relationships, and API design principles.

---

## üìö Project Overview

The API allows users to:

- Retrieve a list of all heroes
- View detailed hero information, including powers
- View and update individual powers
- Assign powers to heroes with specific strength levels
- Handle proper request methods and error handling

The application is built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Migrate, and includes relational database logic with cascading deletes and serialization techniques.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- Flask
- Flask SQLAlchemy
- Flask Migrate
- SQLite (default)
- Postman (for API testing)

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set the Flask App Environment Variable
bash
Copy
Edit
export FLASK_APP=manage.py
5. Run Migrations
bash
Copy
Edit
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
6. Seed the Database
