# Plan to Run the Flask Application

## Information Gathered:
- The application is structured with Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- The database is set up using SQLite, and migrations are handled by Flask-Migrate.
- Initial hero records are seeded through the `seed.py` file.
- The main entry point for running the application is `manage.py`.

## Plan:
1. **Database Migration**:
   - Ensure that the database is migrated to the latest version using Flask-Migrate.
   - Command: `flask db upgrade`

2. **Seeding the Database**:
   - Call the `seed_heroes()` function from `seed.py` to populate the database with initial hero records.
   - This can be done by running `python seed.py`.

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Start the Flask application using `python manage.py`.
   - Ensure it runs on the specified port (5014).

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify that the application is running correctly by accessing the home route and the heroes route.
- Check the database to confirm that the heroes have been seeded successfully.
